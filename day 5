my version to get highest num
-------
high_score = input("score").split()
for x in range (0,len(high_score)):
    high_score [x] = int(high_score[x])
print(high_score)

high_num = 0 
z=[]
for y in high_score:
    z.append(y)
    if z > high_score:
        high_num =y
    else:
        pass

print(f'high num is {y}')


lecture way to get highest num
-----------

high_score = input("score").split()
for x in range (0,len(high_score)):
    high_score [x] = int(high_score[x])
print(high_score)

high_num = 0 
# z=[]
for y in high_score:
#     z.append(y)
    if y > high_num:
        high_num =y
    else:
        pass

print(f'high num is {y}')
